# Family Map Project
Family Map is an Android application that provides a geographical view into your family history. One of the most exciting aspects of family history is discovering your origins. Family Map provides a detailed view into where you came from. 
This project digs a little deeper into the following concepts:
●	Object-Oriented Design
●	User Interface (UI) Programming
●	Native Android Development
●	Calling external services through Web APIs
●	Unit Testing


The Family Map Android application consists of five main views:
●	Main Activity (Login and Top-level map)
●	Event Activity (Lower-level maps)
●	Person Activity
●	Settings Activity
●	Search Activity

The project could be devided into two main parts, the Client and the Server.
The Family Map Client application uses two external services:
●	Family Map Server - Used for user management, data generation, and requesting data (this is the Family Map Server you created in the previous project)
●	Google Maps v2 for Android or Amazon Maps v2 for Kindle - Used for displaying maps
